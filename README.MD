An attempt at restoring the October 2003 Scratch download page and documentation, previously located at https://web.media.mit.edu/~jmaloney/mas714scratch.
The Scratch archiving community has managed to track down a copy of the October 11, 2003 version of Scratch. Additionally, we have also discovered this download page, which I have attempted to restore.
I have added downloads to the October 11, 2003 version of Scratch for Windows; although the Mac version is unavailable, it can be restored by putting the squeak.image file of the 2003 Windows version into the October 2004 version for Mac.
If you have information about versions of Scratch from 2007 or earlier (or the versions themselves), please contact me at retroperson3782@gmail.com.
